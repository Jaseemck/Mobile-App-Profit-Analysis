# Mobile App Profit Analysis

Aim of the project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets. 

The apps that are free to download and install are considered and hence the main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that the revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use the app. Therefore the goal of this project is to analyze data to help understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.

## Getting Started

The code can be run on a jupyter notebook. The data are in csv format. App details from both the Google play store and Ios App store are taken.

The datasets used are:
* [Google Play App Store](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps)
* [IoS App Store](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps)
## Installation

####Please make sure to run in the order of the line of codes in you are using a notebook.
